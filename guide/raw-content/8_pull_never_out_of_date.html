      <h4>Pull in Changes</h4>
      <p>If you're working on something with someone you need to stay up
        to date with the latest version. So you'll want to <strong>pull</strong> in any
        changes that may have been made.</p>

      <h4>What has Reporobot been up to?</h4>
      <p>See if Reporobot has made any changes to your 'add-' branch by pulling
        in from the remote named 'origin' on GitHub:</p>

      <p><code>$ git pull < REMOTENAME > < BRANCHNAME ></code></p>

      <p>If nothing's changed, it will tell you 'Already up-to-date'.
        If there are changes, it will merge those changes into your local
        version.</p>

      <p>Did Reporobot make changes? Git tells you where changes were made.
        You can open that file and see Reporobot's updates. Surprise,
        Reporobot is an artist!</p>

      <p>  When you've pulled, type <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>
