      <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
      <p>Submit a Pull Request to the Patchwork repository.</p>
      <hr>

      <h4>Pull Requests</h4>

      <p>When you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked,
        often you'll want to (and have intended to from the get-go) send
        those changes to the maintainer of the original and <strong>request</strong> that
        they <strong>pull</strong> the changes into the original so that everyone can
        benefit from the updates - that's a <strong>pull request</strong>.</p>

      <p>We want to add you to the list of workshop finishers, so make
        a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original: <a href="www.github.com/jlord/patchwork" target="_blank">www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>.</p>

      <h2>Create a pull request</h3>
      <p>visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
      <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork">http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>.</p>

      <p>Often GitHub will detect if you've pushed a branch to a fork and
      display it at the top of the original's website. If you see that,
      you can click Create Pull Request. If not:</p>

      <p>Click 'Pull request' on the right-side menu, then 'New pull request'.</p>

      <p>Select the branch with the changes you want to submit (it should be
      the one with 'add-' and your username).</p>

      <p>You'll now see a page with the details of the pull request you're
      in the process of submitting. The page shows the commits and changes
      associated with your pull request. If the original repository has a
      contribution documentation, GitHub will link to it. </p>

      <p>If everything good, and as you expect it:</p>

      <p>Click 'Create pull request'</p>

      Add a title and description to the changes you're suggesting the
      original author pull in.

      <p>click 'Send pull request'!</p>

      <p>High five! When you've submitted your pull request, take a few
      seconds to bask in the moment. Then see if your pull request is
      merged right before your eyes! If it is, you're golden, run:</p>
      <p><code>$ git-it verify</code></p>

      <p>If it's not merged automatically within a few moments, you'll then
      likely have some comments from Reporobot on why it couldn't merge
      it. If so, close your pull request on GitHub.com, make the necessary
      changes to your branch, push those changes and resubmit your pull
      request.</p>
