      <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
      <p>Create a new repository on your computer.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Repositories</h2>

    <p>A <strong>repository</strong> is essentially a project. You can imagine it
      as a project's folder with all the related files inside of it. In
      fact, that's what it will look like on your computer anyways.</p>

    <p>You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all
      of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even
      a single letter in a single file changed -- all of it's tracked and
      time stamped by Git.</p>

    <h2>Using Terminal</h2>
    <p>Write about that here.</p>

    <h2>Step: Create a Repository</h2>
    <p>You're going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git
      repository. You'll need some basic terminal (Bash) commands (see
      tips below) for moving around and creating folders (just like you'd do
      in Finder or Windows Explorer).</p>

    <p>To make things easier, name your folder what you`d name the project,
      keep it lowercase, no spaces or symbols. How about `sandwich`.</p>

    <p>You can type all of this here in your terminal window.</p>

    <p>To make a new folder:</p>
    <code>$ mkdir sandwich</code>

    <p>To go into that folder:</p>
    <code>$ cd sandwich</code>

    <p>To create a new Git instance for a project:</p>
    <code>$ git init</code>

    <p>That's it! It will just return you to a new line.</p>
