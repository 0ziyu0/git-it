      <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
      <p>Connect your local and remote repositories and push changes.</p>
      </div>

    <h2>Remotes</h2>

    <p>GitHub.com stores a <strong>remote</strong> copy of your repository (it's
      "remote" because that copy is not on your computer, but on a server
      elsewhere). By <strong>pushing</strong> your <strong>local</strong> (on your computer)
      changes to it, you keep it up to date. That way others can always get the
      latest, too. And everyone can work on a project together without needing
      access to your computer where your local copy is stored.</p>

    <h2>Step: Create a Remote Repository</h2>
    <p>You want to sync your <strong>local</strong> version with one stored on GitHub.com
      called the <strong>remote</strong> version. So first create an empty
      remote repository on GitHub.com.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href="http://www.github.com/" target="_blank">www.github.com</a>, log in, and click the '+' in the top
    right to create a new repository.</li>
      <li>Give it a name that matches your local repository's name and a short
    description.</li>
      <li>Make it public.</li>
      <li>Don`t initialize with a README because we already have a file named
    <code>readme.md</code>.</li>
      <li>Leave .gitignore and license on 'none'.</li>
      <li>Click create repository!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Readmes, .gitignores and Licenses</h2>
    <p>These are common files in open source projects.</p>

    <p>A <strong>readme</strong> explains what the project is, how to use it, and often
    times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file,
    CONTRIBUTING.md, for those details).</p>

    <p>A <strong>.gitignore</strong> is a list of files that Git should <em>not</em> track, for instance, files with passwords!</p>

    <p>A <strong>license</strong> file is the type of license you put on your project,
    information on the types is here:
    <a href="http://www.choosealicense.com" target="_blank">www.choosealicense.com</a>.</p>
    <p>We don`t need any of them, however, for this example.</p>

    <h2>Step: Connect your Local to your Remote</h2>
    <p>Now you've got an empty repository started on GitHub.com. At the
    top you'll see 'Quick Setup', make sure the 'HTTP' button is
    selected and copy the address - this is the location of your
    repository on GitHub.</p>

    <p>Back in your terminal, and inside of the folder that you
    initialized as a Git repository in the previous challenge, you
    want to tell Git the location of the remote version. This is
    commonly named <code>origin</code>.</p>

    <code>$ git remote add origin &#60;URLFROMGITHUB&#62;</code>

    <p>Your <strong>local</strong> version is now connected to the
      <strong>remote</strong> on GitHub.com.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>A note:</strong></p>
    <p>If you have GitHub for Windows on your computer, a remote
      named 'origin' is automatically created. In that case, you'll
      just need to tell it what URL to associate with origin. Use this
      command instead of the 'add' one above:</p>

    <code>$ git remote set-url origin &#60;URLFROMGITHUB&#62;</code>
    </blockquote>



    <h2>Step: Push Work to your Remote</h2>
    <p>Next you want to <strong>push</strong> everything you've done locally
      to GitHub.</p>

    <p>Git has a branching system so that you can work on different
      parts of a project at different times. By default the first
      branch is named master. When you push (and later pull) from
      a project, you tell Git the branch name you want and the
      name of the remote that it lives on.</p>

    <code>$ git push origin master</code>

    <p>For a visual on how branches work in a project, see this
      GitHub Guide: <a href="http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/" target="_blank">guides.github.com/overviews/flow</a></p>

    <p>Now go to GitHub and refresh the page of your repository. WOAH!
      Everything is the same locally and remotely. Congrats on your
      first public repository!</p>
