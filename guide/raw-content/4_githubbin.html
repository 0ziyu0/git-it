      <div class="challenge">
        <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
        <p>Create a GitHub account, add username to your Git config.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Better, together</h2>

      <p>The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which
        is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share and work with others on.
        No worries, that's what GitHubis for!</p>

      <h2>Step: Create a GitHub Account</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a website that allows people everywhere to upload what
        they're working on with Git and to easily work together.</p>

      <p>Visit <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and sign up for a free account.
      <strong>High five, welcome!</strong></p>

      <h2>Step: Add username to Git</h2>
      <p>Add your GitHub username to your Git configuration,
      which will be needed in order to verify the upcoming challenges. Save it exactly as you created it on GitHub â€” <strong>capitialize where capitalized</strong>.</p>

      <p>Add your GitHub username to your configuration:</p>

      <code>$ git config --global user.username gitHubUsername</code>
      <br><br>

      <div class="verify">
        <h3>Verify with </h3> <code>git-it verify </code>
