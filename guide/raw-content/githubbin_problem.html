      <h2>Configure Git and GitHub.</h2>

      <p>The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which
        is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share and work with others on.
        No worries, that's what GitHub.com is for! In this challenge,
        get Git and GitHub configured.</p>

      <h4>Create a GitHub Account</h4>
      <p>GitHub is a website that allows people everywhere to share what
        they're working on with Git and to easily work together.</p>

      <p>Visit <strong><a href="http://www.github.com">http://www.github.com</a></strong> and sign up for a free account.
      High five, welcome!</p>

      <h2>Configure Git</h2>
      <p>You can also add your GitHub username to your Git configuration,
      which will be needed in order to verify the upcoming challenges:</p>

      <p>Add your GitHub username to your configuration:</p>

      <p>$ git config --global user.username githubusername</p>

      <p>When you've set everything up, run <code>git-it verify</code></p>
