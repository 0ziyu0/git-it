      <h2>Install Git.</h2>

      <h4>Get Git</h4>

      <p>Git is <strong>open source software</strong> (free for anyone to use) written
        by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system. </p>
      <p>It is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in
        programming as <strong>version control</strong>.</p>

      <h4>To install Git</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows: It's recommended to download GitHub for Windows,
        which includes Git and has an easier install:
        <strong>windows.github.com</strong>.</li>

        <li>Mac: You can also download GitHub for Mac, which includes
        Git, <strong>mac.github.com</strong> (from Preferences, select
        the command line tools install), or Git by itself:
        <strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></strong>.
        Follow the installation instructions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Git isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not
      see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you
      and you'll be able to access it at anytime from your
      terminal (which you're in right now!) or Git desktop applications.</p>

      <p>Once it is installed, open terminal (aka Bash, aka Shell, aka Prompt).
      You can verify that it's really there by typing:</p>

      <p><code>$ git --version </code></p>

      <p>This will return the version of Git that you're running.Next, configure
        Git so it knows who to associate your changes to:</p>

      <p>Set your name:</p>
      <p><code>$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></p>
      <p>Now set your email:</p>
      <p><code>$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com</code></p>
      <p>When you're done type into terminal:</p>
      <p><code>$ git-it verify </code></p>

      <p>PRO TIP: Dollar signs are often used in programming documentation
      to signify that the line is command line code. You don't actually
      type it in, though, only type <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>

      <p>When you finish each challenge, type <code>git-it</code> to see the menu and
      go to the next challenge. Some of the challenges are longer than the
      screen, so don't forget to scroll up to where it begins after it
      loads!</p>
