<p>Configure Git and GitHub.</p>
<hr>
<p>The repository you&#39;ve created so far is just on your computer, which
  is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share and work with others on.
  No worries, that&#39;s what GitHub.com is for! In this challenge,
  get Git and GitHub configured.</p>
<h2>Create a GitHub Account</h2>
<p>GitHub is a website that allows people everywhere to share what
  they&#39;re working on with Git and to easily work together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit <strong><a href="http://www.github.com">http://www.github.com</a></strong> and sign up for a free account.</li>
<li><p>High five, welcome!</p>
<h2>Configure Git</h2>
<p>You can also add your GitHub username to your Git configuration,
which will be needed in order to verify the upcoming challenges:</p>
<p>Add your GitHub username to your configuration:</p>
<p>$ git config --global user.username githubusername</p>
<p>When you&#39;ve set everything up, run <code>git-it verify</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
