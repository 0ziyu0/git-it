<p>Fork a project from GitHub.com and clone it locally.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now you&#39;ve made a project locally and pushed it to GitHub, but that&#39;s
  only half the fun. The other half is working with other people and
  projects.</p>
<p>When you <strong>fork</strong> a repository, you&#39;re creating a copy of it on
  your GitHub.com account. Forks are used for creating your own
  version of a project or contributing back fixes or features to the
  original project. </p>
<p>Once a project is forked, you then <strong>clone</strong> (aka copy) it from
  GitHub to your computer to work on locally.</p>
<h2>Fork</h2>
<p>The project we&#39;ll work with is <strong>www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</strong>. Go
  to that site and click the fork button at the top right. Once the
  fork animation is complete, you&#39;ve got a copy on your account. Copy
  your fork&#39;s HTTP URL on the right side.</p>
<h2>Clone a Repository</h2>
<p>Now, in terminal, clone the repository. It will create a new folder
  for the repository so no need to create one. But make sure you aren&#39;t
  cloning it inside of another Git repository folder! So, if you&#39;re still
  inside of the repository you created in the early challenges,
  back out of that folder: <code>cd ..</code></p>
<p><code>$ git clone <URL></code></p>
<p>Navigate into that folder (in this case, named &#39;patchwork&#39;)</p>
<p><code>$ cd patchwork</code></p>
<p>Now you&#39;ve got a copy of the repository on your computer and it is
  automatically connected to the remote repository (your forked copy)
  on your GitHub account.</p>
<h2>
  Connect to the Original Repository</h2>
<p>But what if the original repository you forked changes? You&#39;ll want
  to be able to <strong>pull</strong> in those changes too. So let&#39;s add a remote
  connection to the original, <strong>github.com/jlord/patchwork</strong>, repository
  with its URL, found on the right hand side of the original on GitHub.</p>
<p>You can name this remote connection anything you want, but often
  people use &#39;upstream&#39;, let&#39;s use that for this.</p>
<p><code>$ git remote add upstream <a href="https://github.com/jlord/patchwork.git">https://github.com/jlord/patchwork.git</a></code></p>
<p>When you&#39;ve done these steps, run <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Add remote connections</strong></p>
<p><code>$ git remote add <REMOTENAME> <URL></code></p>
<p><strong>View remote connections</strong></p>
<p><code>$ git remote -v</code></p>
