<p>  Fork a project from GitHub.com and clone it locally.</p>
<hr>
<p>  Now you&#39;ve made a project locally and pushed it to GitHub, but that&#39;s
  only half the fun. The other half is working with other people and
  projects.</p>
<p>  When you {bold}fork{/bold} a repository, you&#39;re creating a copy of it on 
  your GitHub.com account. Forks are used for creating your own
  version of a project or contributing back fixes or features to the
  original project. </p>
<p>  Once a project is forked, you then {bold}clone{/bold} (aka copy) it from
  GitHub to your computer to work on locally.</p>

  Fork{/bold}
  ----{/cyan}</p>
<p>  The project we&#39;ll work with is {bold}www.github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}. Go
  to that site and click the fork button at the top right. Once the
  fork animation is complete, you&#39;ve got a copy on your account. Copy 
  your fork&#39;s HTTP URL on the right side.</p>

  Clone a Repository{/bold}
  -------------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>  Now, in terminal, clone the repository. It will create a new folder
  for the repository so no need to create one. But make sure you aren&#39;t
  cloning it inside of another Git repository folder! So, if you&#39;re still
  inside of the repository you created in the early challenges, 
  back out of that folder: <code>cd ..</code></p>
<p>  $ git clone <URL></p>
<p>  Navigate into that folder (in this case, named &#39;patchwork&#39;)</p>
<p>  $ cd patchwork</p>
<p>  Now you&#39;ve got a copy of the repository on your computer and it is
  automatically connected to the remote repository (your forked copy) 
  on your GitHub account.</p>
<p>  {bold}{cyan}
  Connect to the Original Repository{/bold}
  ----------------------------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>  But what if the original repository you forked changes? You&#39;ll want
  to be able to {bold}pull{/bold} in those changes too. So let&#39;s add a remote
  connection to the original, {bold}github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}, repository 
  with its URL, found on the right hand side of the original on GitHub.</p>
<p>  You can name this remote connection anything you want, but often
  people use &#39;upstream&#39;, let&#39;s use that for this.</p>
<p>  $ git remote add upstream <a href="https://github.com/jlord/patchwork.git">https://github.com/jlord/patchwork.git</a></p>
<p>  When you&#39;ve done these steps, run <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>
