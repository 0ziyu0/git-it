<h2>Connect your local and remote repositories and push changes.</h2>

<p>GitHub.com stores a <strong>remote</strong> copy of your repository (it`s
  `remote` because that copy is not on your computer, but on a server
  elsewhere). By <strong>pushing</strong> your <strong>local</strong> (on your computer)
  changes to it, you keep it up to date. That way others can always get the
  latest, too. And everyone can work on a project together without needing
  access to your computer where your local copy is stored.</p>

<h4>Create a Remote Repository<h4>
<p>You want to sync your <strong>local</strong> version with one stored on GitHub.com
  called the <strong>remote</strong> version. So first create an empty
  remote repository on GitHub.com.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <strong>www.github.com</strong>, log in, and click the `+` in the top
right to create a new repository.</li>
  <li>Give it a name that matches your local repository`s name and a short
description.</li>
  <li>Make it public.</li>
  <li>Don`t initialize with a README because we already have a file named
<code>readme.md</code>.</li>
  <li>Leave .gitignore and license on `none`.</li>
  <li><p>Click create repository!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Readmes, .gitignores and Licenses</p>
<p>These are common files in open source projects.</p>

<p>A <strong>readme</strong> explains what the project is, how to use it, and often
times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file,
CONTRIBUTING.md, for those details).</p>

<p>A <strong>.gitignore</strong> is a list of files that Git should <em>not</em> track
(for instance, files with passwords!).</p>

<p>A <strong>license</strong> file is the type of license you put on your project,
information on the types is here:
<strong>www.choosealicense.com</strong>.</p>
<p>We don`t need any of them, however, for this example.</p>

<h4>Connect your Local to your Remote</h4>
<p>Now you`ve got an empty repository started on GitHub.com. At the
top you`ll see `Quick Setup`, make sure the `HTTP` button is
selected and copy the address - this is the location of your
repository on GitHub.</p>

<p>Back in your terminal, and inside of the folder that you
initialized as a Git repository in the previous challenge, you
want to tell Git the location of the remote version. This is
commonly named <code>origin</code>.</p>

<p>$ git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB></p>

<hr>
<p>A note:</p>
<p>If you have GitHub for Windows on your computer, a remote
  named `origin` is automatically created. In that case, you`ll
  just need to tell it what URL to associate with origin. Use this
  command instead of the `add` one above:</p>

<p>$ git remote set-url origin <URLFROMGITHUB></p>

<p>Your <strong>local</strong> version is now connected to the
  <strong>remote</strong> on GitHub.com.</p>

<h4>Push Work to your Remote</h4>
<p>  Next you want to <strong>push</strong> everything you`ve done locally
  to GitHub.</p>

<p>  Git has a branching system so that you can work on different
  parts of a project at different times. By default the first
  branch is named master. When you push (and later pull) from
  a project, you tell Git the branch name you want and the
  name of the remote that it lives on.</p>

<p>  $ git push origin master</p>

<p>  For a visual on how branches work in a project, see this
  GitHub Guide: <strong>guides.github.com/overviews/flow/</strong></p>

<p>  Now go to GitHub and refresh the page of your repository. WOAH!
  Everything is the same locally and remotely. Congrats on your
  first public repository!</p>

<p>  When you`re synced locally and on GitHub.com, run:</p>
<p>  $ git-it verify</p>
