<p>  Connect your local and remote repositories and push changes.</p>
<hr>
<p>  GitHub.com stores a {bold}remote{/bold} copy of your repository (it&#39;s
  &#39;remote&#39; because that copy is not on your computer, but on a server
  elsewhere). By {bold}pushing{/bold} your {bold}local{/bold} (on your computer) 
  changes to it, you keep it up to date. That way others can always get the 
  latest, too. And everyone can work on a project together without needing
  access to your computer where your local copy is stored.</p>

  Create a Remote Repository{/bold}
  --------------------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>  You want to sync your {bold}local{/bold} version with one stored on GitHub.com
  called the {bold}remote{/bold} version. So first create an empty
  remote repository on GitHub.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to {bold}www.github.com{/bold}, log in, and click the &#39;+&#39; in the top 
right to create a new repository.</li>
<li>Give it a name that matches your local repository&#39;s name and a short
description.</li>
<li>Make it public.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t initialize with a README because we already have a file named 
<code>readme.md</code>.</li>
<li>Leave .gitignore and license on &#39;none&#39;.</li>
<li><p>Click create repository!</p>
<p>{cyan}
Readmes, .gitignores and Licenses{/cyan}</p>
<p>These are common files in open source projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A {bold}readme{/bold} explains what the project is, how to use it, and often 
times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file, 
CONTRIBUTING.md, for those details).</p>
</li>
<li>A {bold}.gitignore{/bold} is a list of files that Git should <em>not</em> track 
(for instance, files with passwords!).</li>
<li><p>A {bold}license{/bold} file is the type of license you put on your project, 
information on the types is here:
{bold}www.choosealicense.com{/bold}.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t need any of them, however, for this example.</p>
<p>{bold}{cyan}
Connect your Local to your Remote{/bold}
---------------------------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>Now you&#39;ve got an empty repository started on GitHub.com. At the
top you&#39;ll see &#39;Quick Setup&#39;, make sure the &#39;HTTP&#39; button is
selected and copy the address - this is the location of your
repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Back in your terminal, and inside of the folder that you
initialized as a Git repository in the previous challenge, you
want to tell Git the location of the remote version. This is
commonly named <code>origin</code>.</p>
<p>$ git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>  A note:</p>
<p>  If you have GitHub for Windows on your computer, a remote
  named &#39;origin&#39; is automatically created. In that case, you&#39;ll
  just need to tell it what URL to associate with origin. Use this
  command instead of the &#39;add&#39; one above:</p>
<h2 id="-git-remote-set-url-origin-urlfromgithub-">  $ git remote set-url origin <URLFROMGITHUB></h2>
<p>  Your {bold}local{/bold} version is now connected to the
  {bold}remote{/bold} on GitHub.com.</p>
<p>  {bold}{cyan}
  Push Work to your Remote{/bold}
  ---------------------------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>  Next you want to {bold}push{/bold} everything you&#39;ve done locally
  to GitHub.</p>
<p>  Git has a branching system so that you can work on different
  parts of a project at different times. By default the first
  branch is named master. When you push (and later pull) from
  a project, you tell Git the branch name you want and the
  name of the remote that it lives on.</p>
<p>  $ git push origin master</p>
<p>  For a visual on how branches work in a project, see this
  GitHub Guide: {bold}guides.github.com/overviews/flow/{/bold}</p>
<p>  Now go to GitHub and refresh the page of your repository. WOAH!
  Everything is the same locally and remotely. Congrats on your
  first public repository!</p>
<p>  When you&#39;re synced locally and on GitHub.com, run:</p>
<p>  $ git-it verify</p>
