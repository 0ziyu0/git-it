<p>  Git is {bold}open source software{/bold} (free for anyone to use) written
  by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system. </p>
<p>  It is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in 
  programming as {bold}version control{/bold}.</p>
<p>  {cyan}To install Git{/cyan}</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Windows: It&#39;s recommended to download GitHub for Windows,
which includes Git and has an easier install: 
{bold}windows.github.com{/bold}.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mac: You can also download GitHub for Mac, which includes 
Git, {bold}mac.github.com{/bold} (from Preferences, select
the command line tools install), or Git by itself: 
{bold}<a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads{/bold}">http://git-scm.com/downloads{/bold}</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Follow the installation instructions.</p>
<p>Git isn&#39;t like other programs on your computer. You&#39;ll likely not 
see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you
and you&#39;ll be able to access it at anytime from your 
terminal (which you&#39;re in right now!) or Git desktop applications.</p>
<p>Once it is installed, open terminal (aka Bash, aka Shell, aka Prompt). 
You can verify that it&#39;s really there by typing:</p>
<p>$ git --version </p>
<p>This will return the version of Git that you&#39;re running.</p>
<p>Next, configure Git so it knows who to associate your changes to:</p>
<p>Set your name:</p>
<p>$ git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;</p>
<p>Now set your email:</p>
<p>$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com</p>
<p>When you&#39;re done type into terminal:</p>
<p>$ git-it verify </p>
<p>PRO TIP: Dollar signs are often used in programming documentation
to signify that the line is command line code. You don&#39;t actually 
type it in, though, only type <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>
<p>When you finish each challenge, type <code>git-it</code> to see the menu and
go to the next challenge. Some of the challenges are longer than the
screen, so don&#39;t forget to scroll up to where it begins after it 
loads!</p>
</li>
</ul>
