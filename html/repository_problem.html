<p>  Create a new Git repository.</p>
<hr>
<p>  A {bold}repository{/bold} is essentially a project. You can imagine it
  as a project&#39;s folder with all the related files inside of it. In
  fact, that&#39;s what it will look like on your computer anyways.</p>
<p>  You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all
  of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even
  a single letter in a single file added -- all of it&#39;s tracked and
  time stamped by Git.</p>

  Create a Repository{/bold}
  -------------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>  You&#39;re going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git
  repository. You&#39;ll need some basic terminal (Bash) commands (see 
  below) for moving around and creating folders (just like you&#39;d do 
  in Finder or Windows Explorer). </p>
<p>  To make things easier, name your folder what you&#39;d name the project,
  keep it lowercase, no spaces or symbols. How about &#39;sandwich&#39;.</p>
<p>  You can type all of this here in your terminal window.</p>
<p>  To make a new folder:</p>
<p>  $ mkdir sandwich</p>
<p>  To go into that folder:</p>
<p>  $ cd sandwich</p>
<p>  To create a new Git instance for a project:</p>
<p>  $ git init</p>
<p>  That&#39;s it! It will just return you to a new line.</p>
<p>  When you&#39;ve initialized a new Git repository, run:</p>
<p>  $ git-it verify</p>
