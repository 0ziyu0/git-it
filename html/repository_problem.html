<h2>Create a new Git repository.</p>

<p>A <strong>repository</strong> is essentially a project. You can imagine it
  as a project`s folder with all the related files inside of it. In
  fact, that`s what it will look like on your computer anyways.</p>

<p>You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all
  of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even
  a single letter in a single file added -- all of it`s tracked and
  time stamped by Git.</p>

<h2>Create a Repository</h2>
<p>You`re going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git
  repository. You`ll need some basic terminal (Bash) commands (see
  below) for moving around and creating folders (just like you`d do
  in Finder or Windows Explorer).</p>

<p>To make things easier, name your folder what you`d name the project,
  keep it lowercase, no spaces or symbols. How about `sandwich`.</p>

<p>  You can type all of this here in your terminal window.</p>

<p>  To make a new folder:</p>
<p>  $ mkdir sandwich</p>

<p>  To go into that folder:</p>
<p>  $ cd sandwich</p>

<p>  To create a new Git instance for a project:</p>
<p>  $ git init</p>

<p>  That`s it! It will just return you to a new line.</p>
<p>  When you`ve initialized a new Git repository, run:</p>
<p>  $ git-it verify</p>
