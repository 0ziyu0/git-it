<p>  Submit a Pull Request.</p>
<hr>
<p>  When you make changes and improvements to a project you&#39;ve forked,
  often you&#39;ll want to (and have intended to from the get-go) send 
  those changes to the maintainer of the original and {bold}request{/bold} that 
  they {bold}pull{/bold} the changes into the original so that everyone can 
  benefit from the updates - that&#39;s a {bold}pull request{/bold}.</p>
<p>  We want to add you to the list of workshop finishers, so make
  a {bold}pull request{/bold} to the original: {bold}www.github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}.</p>

  Create a pull request
  ---------------------{/bold}{/cyan}</p>
<ul>
<li><p>visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
{bold}<a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}">http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}</a></p>
<p>Often GitHub will detect if you&#39;ve pushed a branch to a fork and 
display it at the top of the original&#39;s website. If you see that, 
you can click Create Pull Request. If not:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click &#39;Pull request&#39; on the right-side menu, then &#39;New pull request&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the branch with the changes you want to submit (it should be
the one with &#39;add-&#39; and your username).</p>
<p>You&#39;ll now see a page with the details of the pull request you&#39;re
in the process of submitting. The page shows the commits and changes 
associated with your pull request. If the original repository has a 
contribution documentation, GitHub will link to it. </p>
<p>If everything good, and as you expect it:</p>
</li>
<li><p>click &#39;Create pull request&#39;</p>
</li>
<li>Add a title and description to the changes you&#39;re suggesting the 
original author pull in.</li>
<li><p>click &#39;Send pull request&#39;!</p>
<p>High five! When you&#39;ve submitted your pull request, take a few 
seconds to bask in the moment. Then see if your pull request is
merged right before your eyes! If it is, you&#39;re golden, run:</p>
<p>$ git-it verify</p>
<p>If it&#39;s not merged automatically within a few moments, you&#39;ll then 
likely have some comments from Reporobot on why it couldn&#39;t merge
it. If so, close your pull request on GitHub.com, make the necessary
changes to your branch, push those changes and resubmit your pull
request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
