<p>  Submit a Pull Request.</p>
<hr>
<p>  When you make changes and improvements to a project you`ve forked,
  often you`ll want to (and have intended to from the get-go) send
  those changes to the maintainer of the original and <strong>request</strong> that
  they <strong>pull</strong> the changes into the original so that everyone can
  benefit from the updates - that`s a <strong>pull request</strong>.</p>
<p>  We want to add you to the list of workshop finishers, so make
  a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original: <strong>www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</strong>.</p>
<h2>Create a pull request</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
<strong><a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork">http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</strong></a></p>
<p>Often GitHub will detect if you`ve pushed a branch to a fork and
display it at the top of the original`s website. If you see that,
you can click Create Pull Request. If not:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click `Pull request` on the right-side menu, then `New pull request`.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the branch with the changes you want to submit (it should be
the one with `add-` and your username).</p>
<p>You`ll now see a page with the details of the pull request you`re
in the process of submitting. The page shows the commits and changes
associated with your pull request. If the original repository has a
contribution documentation, GitHub will link to it. </p>
<p>If everything good, and as you expect it:</p>
</li>
<li><p>click `Create pull request`</p>
</li>
<li>Add a title and description to the changes you`re suggesting the
original author pull in.</li>
<li><p>click `Send pull request`!</p>
<p>High five! When you`ve submitted your pull request, take a few
seconds to bask in the moment. Then see if your pull request is
merged right before your eyes! If it is, you`re golden, run:</p>
<p>$ git-it verify</p>
<p>If it`s not merged automatically within a few moments, you`ll then
likely have some comments from Reporobot on why it couldn`t merge
it. If so, close your pull request on GitHub.com, make the necessary
changes to your branch, push those changes and resubmit your pull
request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
