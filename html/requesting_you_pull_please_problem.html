      <h2>Submit a Pull Request.</h2>

      <p>When you make changes and improvements to a project you`ve forked,
        often you`ll want to (and have intended to from the get-go) send
        those changes to the maintainer of the original and <strong>request</strong> that
        they <strong>pull</strong> the changes into the original so that everyone can
        benefit from the updates - that`s a <strong>pull request</strong>.</p>

      <p>We want to add you to the list of workshop finishers, so make
        a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original: <strong>www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Create a pull request</h3>
      <p>visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
      <strong><a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork">http://www.github.com/jlord/patchwork</strong></a></p>
      <p>Often GitHub will detect if you`ve pushed a branch to a fork and
      display it at the top of the original`s website. If you see that,
      you can click Create Pull Request. If not:</p>

      <p>Click `Pull request` on the right-side menu, then `New pull request`.</p>

      <p>Select the branch with the changes you want to submit (it should be
      the one with `add-` and your username).</p>

      <p>You`ll now see a page with the details of the pull request you`re
      in the process of submitting. The page shows the commits and changes
      associated with your pull request. If the original repository has a
      contribution documentation, GitHub will link to it. </p>

      <p>If everything good, and as you expect it:</p>

      <p>click `Create pull request`</p>

      Add a title and description to the changes you`re suggesting the
      original author pull in.

      <p>click `Send pull request`!</p>

      <p>High five! When you`ve submitted your pull request, take a few
      seconds to bask in the moment. Then see if your pull request is
      merged right before your eyes! If it is, you`re golden, run:</p>
      <p>$ git-it verify</p>

      <p>If it`s not merged automatically within a few moments, you`ll then
      likely have some comments from Reporobot on why it couldn`t merge
      it. If so, close your pull request on GitHub.com, make the necessary
      changes to your branch, push those changes and resubmit your pull
      request.</p>
