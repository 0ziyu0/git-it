<p>  Keep your file up to date, pull in changes from collaborators.</p>
<hr>
<p>  If you`re working on something with someone you need to stay up
  to date with the latest version. So you`ll want to <strong>pull</strong> in any
  changes that may have been made.</p>
<h2>Pull in Changes</h2>
<p>  See if Reporobot has made any changes to your `add-` branch by pulling
  in from the remote named `origin` on GitHub:</p>
<p>  $ git pull <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME></p>
<p>  If nothing`s changed, it will tell you `Already up-to-date`.
  If there are changes, it will merge those changes into your local
  version.</p>
<p>  Did Reporobot make changes? Git tells you where changes were made.
  You can open that file and see Reporobot`s updates. Surprise,
  Reporobot is an artist!</p>
<p>  When you`ve pulled, type <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>
