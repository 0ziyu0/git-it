  Pull in Changes{/bold}
  -----------------{/cyan}</p>
<p>  See if Reporobot has made any changes to your &#39;add-&#39; branch by pulling
  in from the remote named &#39;origin&#39; on GitHub:</p>
<p>  $ git pull <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME></p>
<p>  If nothing&#39;s changed, it will tell you &#39;Already up-to-date&#39;. 
  If there are changes, it will merge those changes into your local 
  version.</p>
<p>  Did Reporobot make changes? Git tells you where changes were made.
  You can open that file and see Reporobot&#39;s updates. Surprise, 
  Reporobot is an artist!</p>
<p>  When you&#39;ve pulled, type <code>git-it verify</code>.</p>
