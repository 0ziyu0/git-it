        <p>Install Git.

        Get Git{/bold}
        --------{/cyan}

        Git is {bold}open source software{/bold} (free for anyone to use) written
        by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system.

        It is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in
        programming as {bold}version control{/bold}.

        {cyan}To install Git{/cyan}

        - Windows: It's recommended to download GitHub for Windows,
        which includes Git and has an easier install:
        {bold}windows.github.com{/bold}.

        - Mac: You can also download GitHub for Mac, which includes
        Git, {bold}mac.github.com{/bold} (from Preferences, select
        the command line tools install), or Git by itself:
        {bold}http://git-scm.com/downloads{/bold}.

        - Follow the installation instructions.

        Git isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not
        see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you
        and you'll be able to access it at anytime from your
        terminal (which you're in right now!) or Git desktop applications.

        Once it is installed, open terminal (aka Bash, aka Shell, aka Prompt).
        You can verify that it's really there by typing:

        $ git --version

        This will return the version of Git that you're running.

        Next, configure Git so it knows who to associate your changes to:

        Set your name:

        $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

        Now set your email:

        $ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com

        When you're done type into terminal:

        $ git-it verify

        PRO TIP: Dollar signs are often used in programming documentation
        to signify that the line is command line code. You don't actually
        type it in, though, only type `git-it verify`.

        When you finish each challenge, type `git-it` to see the menu and
        go to the next challenge. Some of the challenges are longer than the
        screen, so don't forget to scroll up to where it begins after it
        loads!
