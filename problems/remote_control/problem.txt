  Push your repository to GitHub.com for sharing.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which
  makes it pretty hard to share and get help from others on. That's 
  what GitHub.com helps with! 

  You want to sync your {bold}local{/bold} version with one stored on GitHub.com,
  called the {bold}remote{/bold} version.

  - Go to www.github.com, log in, and click a '+' in the top right to
  create a new repository.
  - Give it a name that matches your local repository and a short description.
  - For now, don't add a readme, .gitignore or license file.
  - Click create!

  Now you've got an empty repository started on GitHub.com. On the 
  right side of the page, mid way down, you'll find a small bar with
  labeled 'HTTPS clone URL'. This is the address to your remote
  repository; copy it.

  {bold}{cyan}
  Add your remote to your local{/bold}{/cyan}
  -----------------------------

  Back in your terminal, you want to tell Git the location of the
  remote version.

  $ git remote origin add <http://urlfromgithub.com>

  Now you want to {bold}push{/bold} everything you've done locally
  to GitHub on a branch named master (we'll learn more about branches
  later).

  $ git push origin master

  Go refresh your repository on GitHub.com. WOAH!
