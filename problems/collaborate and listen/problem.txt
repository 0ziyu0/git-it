  Add Collaborators{/bold}
  -----------------{/cyan}
  
  Add collaborators to a project (who will be granted the ability to 
  edit repository file) by going to your repositories webpage and
  clicking the 'Settings' icon on the right side menu. Then select 
  'Security' tab.

  this exercise. YAY!

  Pull in Changes{/bold}
  -----------------{/cyan}
  
  When you are working with someone on a project, you'll both have a copy
  of the repository on your computer and you'll share the remote
  repository on GitHub.com. 
  
  This means you need to stay up to date with each others changes. Before
  you start making changes yourself, you should **pull** in any changes
  that may have been made by a collaborator. Check if RR has made updates.
  
  $ git pull origin master
  
  {red}- dare I add merge a merge conflict to this challenge?{/red}
  
  Do it again just to see what message it returns when your local copy
  matches the remote copy.
