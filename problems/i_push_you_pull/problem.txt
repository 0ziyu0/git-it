  Submit a Pull Request.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  When you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked,
  you'll want to send those changes to the maintainer of the original
  and request that they pull them into the original so that everyone 
  can benefit from the updates - that's a {bold}pull request{/bold}.

  Once you {bold}push{/bold} changes to a branch on a fork, GitHub.com will
  recognize this and ask if you want to create a pull request with 
  the changes in that branch.

  To create a Pull Request

  - visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
  http://www.github.com/jlord/REPONAME
  - Click to create a pull request.
  - Describe your changes and submit!
