  Submit a Pull Request.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  When you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked,
  you'll want to send those changes to the maintainer of the original
  and request that they {bold}pull{/bold} the changes into the original so that 
  everyone can benefit from the updates - that's a {bold}pull request{/bold}.

  Once you {bold}push{/bold} changes to a branch on a fork, GitHub.com will
  recognize this and ask if you want to create a pull request with 
  the changes in that branch.

  To create a pull request

  - visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
  http://www.github.com/jlord/REPONAME
  - Click to create a pull request.
  - Describe your changes and submit!
