  Fork a project from GitHub.com and add a collaborator.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Now you've made a project locally and pushed it to GitHub, but that's
  only half the fun. The other half is working with other people and
  projects.

  When you {bold}fork{/bold} a repository, you're creating a copy of
  it on your GitHub.com account. Forks are used for creating your own
  version of a project or contributing back fixes or features to the
  original project. 
  
  Once a project is forked, you then {bold}clone{/bold} it
  to your computer to work on locally.

  Fork{/bold}
  ----{/cyan}

  The project we'll work with is {bold}www.github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}. Go
  to that site and click the fork button at the top right. Once the
  fork animation is complete, you've got a copy on your account. Copy 
  your fork's HTTP URL on the right side.

  Working with others is one of the best things about GitHub.

  You can add {bold}collaborators{/bold} to a project (who will be granted the
  ability to edit repository's files) by going to your repository's
  webpage and clicking the 'Settings' icon on the right side menu.
  Then select 'Security' tab. Type in the username to add.

  Add 'reporobot' as a collaborator on your fork. RR will join us for a
  few of these exercises. 
  
  When you've added RR, type `git-it verify`
