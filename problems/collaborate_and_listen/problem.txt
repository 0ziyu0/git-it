  Pull in Changes{/bold}
  -----------------{/cyan}
  
  When you are working with someone on a project, you'll both have a copy
  of the repository on your computer and you'll share the {bold}remote
  repository{/bold} on GitHub.com. 
  
  This means you need to stay up to date with each others changes. Before
  you start making changes yourself, you should {bold}pull{/bold} in any changes
  that may have been made by a collaborator. Check if RR has made updates.
  
  $ git pull origin master
  
  {red}- dare I add merge a merge conflict to this challenge?{/red}
  
  Do it again just to see what message it returns when your local copy
  matches the remote copy.
