  If you're working on something with someone you need to stay up
  to date with the latest version. So before you start to work, you'll
  want to {bold}pull{/bold} in any changes that may have been made.

  See if Reporobot has made any changes and pull from your branch:

  $ git pull origin <BRANCHNAME>

  If nothing's changed, it will tell you 'Already up-to-date' (try it!). 
  If there are changes, it will merge those changes into your local 
  version.

  Now that your files are up-to-date; add your contribution.
  
  Reporobot added a file, ______. Open that file in a text editor.
  
  $ open _____.
  
  Type your GitHub username in the file and save. That's it.
  
  Now checkin your changes with Git:
  
  $ git status
  $ git add <filename>
  $ git commit -m "commit message"
  
  Push those changes to the branch on GitHub.com:
  
  $ git push origin <BRANCHNAME>
  
  Pulling in changes and pushing changes will be most of your 
  actions while developing.
