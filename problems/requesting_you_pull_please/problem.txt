  Submit a Pull Request.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  When you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked,
  often you'll want to (and have intended to from the get-go) send 
  those changes to the maintainer of the original and request that 
  they {bold}pull{/bold} the changes into the original so that 
  everyone can benefit from the updates - that's a {bold}pull request{/bold}.
  
  We want to add you to the list of workshop completors, so make
  a {bold}pull request{/bold} to the original.

  Once you {bold}push{/bold} changes to a branch on a fork, GitHub.com will
  recognize this when you visit the original and ask if you want to create 
  a pull request with the changes in that branch.

  {cyan}To create a pull request{/cyan}

  - visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
  http://www.github.com/jlord/REPONAME
  - Click to create a pull request.
  - Describe your changes and submit!

  When you're done, type:
  
  $ git-it verify
