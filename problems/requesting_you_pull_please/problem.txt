  Submit a Pull Request.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  When you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked,
  often you'll want to (and have intended to from the get-go) send 
  those changes to the maintainer of the original and {bold}request{/bold} that 
  they {bold}pull{/bold} the changes into the original so that everyone can 
  benefit from the updates - that's a {bold}pull request{/bold}.
  
  We want to add you to the list of workshop completors, so make
  a {bold}pull request{/bold} to the original: {bold}www.github.com/jlord/patchwork{/bold}.

  Once changes have been {bold}pushed{/bold} to a branch on a fork, GitHub.com will
  recognize this and when you visit the original GitHub asks if you 
  want to create a pull request with the changes on that branch.
