  Pull changes from upstream.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you're working on something with someone you need to stay up
  to date with the latest version. So before you start to work, you'll
  want to {bold}pull{/bold} in any changes.

  Pull in any changes that were made to the original:

  $ git pull origin upstream

  If nothing's changed, it will tell you 'Already up-to-date'. If there
  are changes, it will pull those changes into your local version.

  Pull in Changes{/bold}

  When you are working with someone on a project, you'll both have a copy
  of the repository on your computer and you'll share the {bold}remote
  repository{/bold} on GitHub.com.

  This means you need to stay up to date with each others changes. Before
  you start making changes yourself, you should {bold}pull{/bold} in any changes
  that may have been made by a collaborator. Check if RR has made updates.

  $ git pull origin master

  Do it again just to see what message it returns when your local copy
  matches the remote copy.
