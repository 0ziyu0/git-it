  Create a file in your new repository, add something to that file and
  commit those changes to Git.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Now that you've got a repository started, add a file to it. Tell 
  terminal to open file with the name readme.md.

  $ open readme.md

  This should open up your computer's default text editor. Now write a
  couple of lines of text, whatever you want. If you know Markdown,
  jazz it up. Then save.

  you just created to the files you'd like to {bold}commit{/bold} (aka save) 
  to change. Finally, commit those changes to the repository's history 
  with a short description of the updates.See the command hints below!
