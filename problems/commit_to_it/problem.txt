  Create a file in your new repository, add something to that file and
  commit those changes to Git.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Now that you've got a repository started, add a file to it. 
  
  {bold}{cyan}
  New File{/bold}
  --------{/cyan}
  
  Open a text editor. Now write a couple of lines of text, perhaps
  describe the tastiest sandwich you can imagine, and save the
  file in the folder you created in the last lesson.

  {bold}{cyan}
  Check, Add and Commit Changes{/bold}
  -----------------------------{/cyan}

  Next check the {bold}status{/bold} of your repository. Are there changes 
  listed? 
  
  $ git status

  Then {bold}add{/bold} the file you just created to the files you'd 
  like to {bold}commit{/bold} (aka save) to change (for instance,
  if you're file is named readme.md, `git add readme.md`). 
  
  $ git add <FILENAME>

  Finally, commit those changes to the repository's history with a 
  short description of the updates.See the command hints below!
  
  $ git commit -m <MESSAGE>
  
  {bold}{cyan}
  Make More Changes{/bold}
  -----------------------------{/cyan}
  
  Now add another line to your .txt file, perhaps a title, and save.
  
  In terminal, you can view the {bold}diff{/bold}erence between the 
  files now and how they were before you edited. 
  
  $ git diff
  
  Now with what you just learned above, commit that change.
