  Fork and project on GitHub.com and clone it locally.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Now you've made a project locally and pushed it to GitHub, but that's
  only half the fun! The other half is working with other projects.

  When you {bold}fork{/bold} a repository, you're creating a copy of
  it on your GitHub.com account. You can then {bold}clone{/bold} it
  to your computer to work on locally. 

  {bold}{cyan}
  Fork{/bold}
  ----{/cyan}

  The project we'll work with is github.com/jlord/PROJECTREPO. Go
  to that site and click the fork button at the top right. Once the 
  fork is complete, copy your fork's HTTP URL on the right side.

  Now, in terminal, clone the repo.

  $ git clone <URL>

  Navigate into that folder

  $ cd ForkedRepoName

  Now you've got a copy of the repository on your computer and it is
  automatically connected to the remote one on your GitHub account. 
  
  But what if the original repository you forked changes? You'll want 
  to be able to {bold}pull{/bold} in those updates too. So let's add a remote 
  connection to the original repository with its URL.

  You can call this remote connection anything you want, but often
  people use 'upstream'.

  $ git remote add upstream <HTTP URL>
