  Merge branch for much win!

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Your pull request is waiting for review, but meanwhile, since you
  know that you definitely want those updates in your forked version, 
  and your branch is in good working order, merge it into the main,
  branch on your forked repository, in this case, `gh-pages`.

  Tidy up by deleting your feature branch now that it has been merged.
