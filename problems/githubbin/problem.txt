  Configure Git and GitHub.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which
  is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share and work with others on. 
  No worries, that's what GitHub.com is for! In this challenge, 
  get Git and GitHub configured.

  You'll want to let Git know who to associate the changes you make to 
  by telling it your name, GitHub account name and email address.
  
  Then add your GitHub username:
  
  $ git config --global user.username githubusername
  
  When you've set everything up, run `git-it verify`
