Fork and project on GitHub.com and clone it locally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you've made a project locally and pushed it to GitHub, but that's
only half the fun! The other half is working with other projects.

When you {bold}fork{/bold} a repository, you're creating a copy of
it on your GitHub.com account. You can then {bold}clone{/bold} it
to your computer to work on locally. 

The project we'll work with is github.com/jlord/PROJECTREPO. Go
to the site and click the fork button at the top right. Once the 
fork is complete, grab your fork's HTTP URL on the right side.

Now, in terminal, clone the repo.

$ git clone <HTTP URL>

Now you've got a copy of the repository on your computer and it is
automatically connected to the remote one on your GitHub account. 
But what if the original repository you forked changes? You'll want 
to be able to pull in those updates too. So let's add a remote 
connection to the original repository with it's HTTP URL.

You can call this remote connection anything you want, but often
people use 'upstream'.

$ git remote add upstream <HTTP URL>
