  Create a new Git repository.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  A {bold}repository{/bold} is essentialy a project. You can imagine it
  as project's folder with all the related files inside of it. In
  fact, that's what it will look like on your computer anyways.

  You just tell Git what your project is and will start tracking all
  of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even
  a single letter in a single file added -- all of it's tracked and
  time stamped by Git.

  {bold}{cyan}
  Create a Repository{/bold}{/cyan}
  -------------------

  You're going to create a new folder and intitalize it as a Git
  repository. You'll need some basic terminal commands, which
  you'll find below.

  To create a new Git instance for a project, the command is:

  $ git init

  That's it. It will just return you to a new line.

  **BASIC BASH COMMANDS**

  $ mkdir myNewFolder

  {bold}Navigate into an existing folder (aka change directory){/bold}

  $ cd myNewFolder

  {bold}List the items in a folder{/bold}
