  Create a new Git repository.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  A {bold}repository{/bold} is essentialy a project. You can imagine it
  as project's folder with all the related files inside of it. In
  fact, that's what it will look like on your computer anyways.

  You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all
  of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even
  a single letter in a single file added -- all of it's tracked and
  time stamped by Git.

  Create a Repository{/bold}
  -------------------{/cyan}
  
  You're going to create a new folder and intitalize it as a Git
  repository*. You'll need some basic terminal (Bash) commands (below) 
  for moving around and creating folders (just like you'd do in Finder 
  or Windows Explorer). 
  
  To make a new folder:
  
  $ mkdir coolRepo
  
  To go into that folder:
  
  $ cd coolRepo
  
  To create a new Git instance for a project:

  $ git init

  That's it. It will just return you to a new line.
  
  When you've intialized a new Git repository in the new folder run:
  
  $ git-it verify
  
  {red}- need to explain that they have to run verify from inside that folder{/red}

  **BASIC BASH COMMANDS**
  -----------------------

  {bold}Make a new folder (aka directory){/bold}

  $ mkdir myNewFolder

  {bold}Navigate into an existing folder (aka change directory){/bold}

  $ cd myNewFolder

  {bold}List the items in a folder{/bold}

  $ ls {/cyan}

  * If you want, you can create a folder that will contain all of your
  coding work. When you open Terminal you start off in your computer's 
  home (root) directory. From there, create a folder for your code and 
  a folder for your first repository:

  $ mkdir myCode
  $ cd myCode
  $ mkdir coolRepo
