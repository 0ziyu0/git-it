  Branching{/bold}
  ---------{/cyan}

  It's common practice when working on a project or with others on a
  project to create a {bold}branch{/bold} to put your changes in. This
  way you can do you work while the main, commonly named 'master',
  branch stays stable.

  When you create a branch, Git copies everything from the current branch
  you're on and places it in the branch you've requested.

  $ git branch <BRANCHNAME>

  To go into that branch and work on it, similar to using `cd` to change
  directory in terminal, you {bold}checkout{/bold} a branch.

  $ git checkout <BRANCHNAME>

  Create branch and new file{/bold}
  --------------------------{/cyan}

  Create a branch and name it "add-username", where 'username' is 
  your username. Then move onto that branch.
  
  Now, create a new file named "add-username.json". Just write you 
  GitHub username in it and save, that's it, and it within the 
  'contributors' folder.

  Check-in{/bold}

  Go through the steps for checking in a project: 
  
  $ git status
  $ git add <filename>
  $ git commit -m "commit message"
  
  Type `git-it verify` when you're done.

  **GIT TIPS**
  ------------

  You can create and switch to a branch in one line:

  $ git checkout -b <BRANCHNAME>

  Rename a branch you're currently on:
  
  $ git branch -m <NEWBRANCHNAME>

  Verify what branch you're working on

  $ git status{/yellow}
